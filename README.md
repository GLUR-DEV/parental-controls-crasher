# Parental Controls Crasher

A simple software to manage parental controls on x86 and x64 bit windows systems.

**What it includes**

Has all the basic managing features, including kill and start commands, repeat kill commands, a panic button and a process selection table.

**Future of the project**

I will update the project if there is demand, or if there are any bugs or exeptions that I failed to catch.
I might port it to mac or linux. Yet again if there is a demand.
If anyone wants to send me a specific parental controls source, or programs folder files. Then I can work towards making a specific hack for that parental controls app! 

**I will port this to android if we reach a goal of $200. If you want to contribute towards this you can in the donate section v**
